"""Object Request Broker

This module implements the infrastructure needed to transparently create
objects that communicate via networks. This infrastructure consists of:

--  Strub ::
        Represents the image of a remote object on the local machine.
        Used to connect to remote objects. Also called Proxy.
--  Skeleton ::
        Used to listen to incoming connections and forward them to the
        main object.
--  Peer ::
        Class that implements basic bidirectional (Stub/Skeleton)
        communication. Any object wishing to transparently interact with
        remote objects should extend this class.
